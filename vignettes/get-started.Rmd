# Description of your package

This will fill the description of your package.
Fill and run the content of this chunk, before anything else. 

Note: when you will use other flat templates, this part will be in a separate file. Do not be surprised!

# Add one to any value

This is the first tool of our wonderful package. 
You can add `1` to any `value` using function `add_one()`.

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->
# preprocess_data
    
  
```{r example-preprocess_data}
result_nedap <- preprocess_data(data = mintyr::nedap, station_type = "nedap")
head(result_nedap)
```

  

# clean_weight_get
    
  
```{r example-clean_weight_get}
result_nedap <- preprocess_data(data = mintyr::nedap, station_type = "nedap")
clean_weight <- clean_weight_get(result_nedap, my_break = c(30,120), range_offset = 0.5)
head(clean_weight)
```

  

















That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.
